## Overview

These browser-based simulations let you experience the full Viam platform without any hardware. Each simulation walks you through all five lifecycle stages:

1. **Prototype** — Configure components, write control code
2. **Deploy** — Move to a simulated "field" environment
3. **Scale** — Add a second robot, see fleet features
4. **Fleet** — Monitor health, push updates
5. **Maintain** — Debug an issue, push a fix

## What Happens After Simulation

The simulation is designed to mirror real hardware work cells. When you're ready:

1. Check the [Hardware Recommendations](../planning/hardware-recommendations.md) for your work cell
2. Apply the same configuration to real hardware
3. See it work in the physical world
