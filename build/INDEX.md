# Build

*Task-oriented blocks — modular tutorials you compose.*

---

## Overview

Blocks are self-contained tutorials (~15-30 minutes each) that teach a specific capability. They're designed to be composed—complete the ones relevant to your project, skip the ones that aren't.

All blocks work in both simulation and real hardware.

## Block Categories

### [Foundation](./foundation/INDEX.md) 🔴
Start here. Every project needs these basics.
- Connect to Cloud
- Add a Camera
- Capture and Sync Data
- Run ML Inference

### [Perception](./perception/INDEX.md) 🔴
Understanding what the robot sees.
- Detect Objects (2D)
- Classify Objects
- Track Objects Across Frames
- Measure Depth
- Localize Objects in 3D

### [Stationary Vision](./stationary-vision/INDEX.md) 🔴
Vision systems that don't move.
- Trigger on Detection
- Count Objects
- Inspect for Defects
- Monitor Over Time

### [Mobile Base](./mobile-base/INDEX.md) 🔴
Robots that move.
- Control Motors
- Read Odometry
- Build a Map
- Navigate to Waypoint
- Avoid Obstacles
- Follow a Patrol Route

### [Arm + Manipulation](./arm-manipulation/INDEX.md) 🔴
Robots that grab things.
- Move Joints
- Control Gripper
- Move to Pose
- Pick an Object
- Place an Object
- Visual Servoing

### [Integration](./integration/INDEX.md) 🔴
Combining capabilities.
- Detect While Moving
- Navigate to Detected Object
- Pick from Bin
- Mobile Pick-and-Place
- Multi-step Task Sequence

## How to Use Blocks

**If you know what you need:** Jump directly to the relevant block.

**If you're following a work cell guide:** The guide will tell you which blocks to complete in order.

**If you're exploring:** Start with Foundation, then pick a track (Stationary Vision, Mobile Base, or Arm + Manipulation) based on your hardware.

---

## Prerequisites

Each block lists its prerequisites. Some blocks can be done in any order; others build on previous blocks.

---

## After Building

Once you've built your application, continue to:
- [Deploy](../deploy/INDEX.md) — Get it running in the real world
- [Scale](../scale/INDEX.md) — Go from one robot to many
- [Maintain](../maintain/INDEX.md) — Keep it running over time
