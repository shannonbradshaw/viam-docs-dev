## Overview

Reduce bandwidth and storage costs by filtering data before sync. Keep only images with detections, sensor readings outside normal ranges, or samples at specified intervals.

## What You'll Learn

- Configure selective data capture rules
- Filter by detection presence
- Filter by sensor thresholds
- Set sampling intervals

## Prerequisites

- Capture and Sync Data (completed)
- Run ML Inference (optional, for detection-based filtering)

## Problems Addressed

- 2.13: Deciding what data to capture
- 2.14: Data transfer to cloud (bandwidth management)
