## Overview

Building a robotics product means building customer infrastructure—auth systems, dashboards, billing. Viam provides these so you can focus on your product.

## What You'll Learn

- Set up white-label authentication with your branding
- Build customer-facing web dashboards with TypeScript SDK
- Build mobile apps with Flutter SDK
- Configure billing with per-machine or per-data pricing

## Capabilities

### White-Label Authentication
Customers authenticate through a login screen with your logo and branding, not Viam's.

### Customer-Facing Apps
- **TypeScript SDK** for web dashboards
- **Flutter SDK** for iOS and Android apps
- Both handle authentication and provide access to all component and service APIs

### Built-in Billing
Define pricing tiers—per-machine fees, data costs, or both. Viam handles invoicing and payment collection.

## Problems Addressed

- 4.8: Billing and metering
- 4.9: Customer-facing dashboards (implicit)
