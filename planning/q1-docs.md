# Q1 2025 Docs Needed

Running punch list of documentation deliverables.

---

## Conceptual

- [ ] What is Viam?

---

## Tutorials (Browser-Based Simulations)

Each tutorial needs:
- Simulation implementation (Gazebo world + Viam modules)
- Step-by-step tutorial content
- Supporting blocks

### Stationary Vision
- [ ] Simulation: camera + compute work cell
- [ ] Tutorial: object detection, defect inspection, alerts

### Mobile Base
- [ ] Simulation: wheeled robot + camera + lidar work cell
- [ ] Tutorial: autonomous navigation, object detection, patrol

### Arm + Vision
- [x] Simulation: xArm 6 + RGBD cameras work cell (in progress)
- [ ] Tutorial: visual detection, pick-and-place, bin picking

---

## Blocks

Blocks needed to support the three tutorials:

- [ ] (list TBD based on tutorial design)

---

## Reference/Explanation

- [ ] Fragments explanation

---

## Notes

- Tutorials walk users through all 5 lifecycle stages: Prototype → Deploy → Scale → Fleet → Maintain
- Each tutorial ~1-1.5 hours
- Zero installation (browser-based)
